   <h3>Dominic Stefani</h3>
   <h3>Major: Computer Science</h3>
   <h3>Hometown: Port Saint Lucie, FL</h3>
   <p></p> 
   <p>As mentioned above, my major is computer science. Due to my interest in the field and the statistically high likelihood that I will change my major, 
    I am also taking mechanical engineering courses. 
    </p>
    <p>I think of web development and programming as viable fields to pursue due to the high quantity of jobs, good work-life 
        balance, and high pay that are typically associated with them. I have also always had a natural appreciation and aptitude for technology. 
    </p>
    <p>I am excited and enthusiastic to see what this course has to offer!</p>

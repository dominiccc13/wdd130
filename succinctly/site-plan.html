        There is a wealth of information available on the internet. Despite this, finding the information or knowledge you are looking for can sometimes seem impossible. Whether you’re a passionate thinker deep-diving into a new subject, a professional endlessly searching for a specific solution to a technical problem, or just searching for some home-help advice, the internet is often overwhelming. 

        However, my website aims to provide several critical, key articles, podcasts, or short videos on whatever topic you may be interested in. Just enter your interested topic, hit enter, and you will find specific, detailed articles and videos on the subject presented with an easy to navigate, sleek and modern style. Just a few words and a click, and you will have many more specific and individually tailored results than the broad, overwhelming, and confusing results provided by a google search.
        
        Activities users may want to complete: Users may want to save articles in the future on their accounts. They also may like a share feature for articles or videos they find embedded on the site. Or a save feature. It may also be beneficial to allow them to take notes, as the gospel library app allows. Perhaps they could highlight a line from an article that is embedded on the website and make an annotation or note that the website will save there as an annotation, as long as they are signed in.

      <h3>Computer Hardware</h3>
      <p>
        Computer basic knowledge: If you want to learn more about what goes into computers-whether it be for the sake of building a custom desktop, being more informed as a consumer and therefore making a better purchase of a “pre-build,” or desktop sold by a company that is already completely assembled, or you are a technical specialist wanting to refresh your knowledge or learn more about the newest topic-it will first be beneficial to identify what PART of a computer you want to learn about. We will first cover the basic components of an average computer, what they are, what functions they perform, and then will provide some more specific technical knowledge into how each component works.

Computers are made up of multiple parts: Computers are made up of several fundamental parts. They are present in almost all computers. A good starting point is a component called the motherboard. Every computer has a motherboard. This is essentially a large circuit board that enables all of the other components to connect and talk to each other. (Research and provide more information.)

CPUs: The next component to consider is the central processing unit, or CPU. This is one of the most important parts of your computer. You've likely already heard that acronym at some point before. It does exactly what it's name would suggest: it processes the vast majority of information that contributes directly to whatever you're doing on your computer. (Research and provide more information.)

GPUs: Another similar component is the graphics processing unit, or GPU for short. This is similar, although it is responsible for rendering individual pixels, like in videos or video games. Not all computers have a GPU, but they are often built into the motherboard. But things like gaming or other taxing processes will certainly benefit greatly from a GPU! (Research and provide more information.)

Storage: We can next explore various storage types. The first will be a simple drive. This stores information. These are usually hard drives or solid state drives. (Research and provide more information.)

Random access memory: Next we will explore random access memory. (Research and provide more information.)

      <h3>3D Design</h3>
      <p>
        3D design intro: 3D design is an intricate and extremely technical aspect of post-production in media. It requires great proficiency and a highly specialized skill set. Thankfully, these skills can be learned, and there is a wealth of information available on the subject. 

        3D design has multiple facets: The first idea that one must have about 3D design is that 3D design has many facets to it. It is not one practice or study, but multiple. The most fundamental of these and perhaps the first step in any 3D design process is the acquisition of or creation of a model. This is usually referred to simply as 3D modeling. 

        3D models: 3D modeling involves either purchasing a model from a website, a freelancer, a company, etc. In fact, even some movies or franchises will sell the rights to their models! Many more freelancers and individual content creators will create replicas of these models, and sometimes with extreme detail and effort, resulting in a product that may be even more hyper realistic than what was created for the original artwork. 

        Creating your own models (doing your own modeling): It is also possible to create your own 3D models. Most models work around providing simple geometric shapes that can then be contorted, altered, and shaped to create models like people, animals, characters, etc. Most models you see in movies and television actually started in a simple program from shapes like cubes and spheres!

        3D animation: The next component of 3D design, perhaps most commonly known, is animation. This involves using some 3D software (which we will get into later) to program the movement of your 3D model. This is critical in media types like video game design and modern cinema. Animation can be applied to biological models like humans and animals, it can also be applied to machines and other 3D created objects (a good example is the Transformers series), or it can even be applied to simple 3D text seen in a movie trailer. Animation is just as vital to the process as modeling.

        3D design programs: With the fact that there are many different components of the 3D design subject, we can now explore the various programs and softwares available for different aspects of 3D design, what they do, some basic information about them, and what processes they specifically are used for. (Provide information about programs like the Unreal Engine, Blender, Cinema 4D, Video Copilot’s Element 3D for Adobe After Effects, and others.)

        3D design others: Other, seemingly less fundamental aspects of 3D design include texturing, rigging, physics, and more. Click the associated subject to learn more (feature not yet available).
